# Resources for Machine Learning Operations with R

This repository contains resources for the talk "Machine Learning Operations with R".

Azure Machine Learning service (Azure ML) is Microsoft’s cloud-based machine
learning platform that enables data scientists and their teams to carry out
end-to-end machine learning workflows at scale. With Azure ML's new open-source
R SDK and R capabilities, you can take advantage of the platform’s
enterprise-grade features to train, tune, manage and deploy R-based machine
learning models and applications.
